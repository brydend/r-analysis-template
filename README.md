# R Analysis Template

The purpose of this repository is to offer a template for R analysis in an Excel world.

As R begins to replace a lot Excel work, a clear template is needed to explain how it works and offer fast development. There will be people in the business that do not use R, and they need confidence that any analysis has been performed correctly.

## When to use R

As soon as there is a copy and paste in Excel in something that is repeatable, we use R.

## Template Structure

* load.R - calls libraries, sources helpers and functions
* run-scripts.R - runs all scripts in the designated folders
