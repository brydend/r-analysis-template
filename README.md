# R Analysis Template

The purpose of this repository is to offer a template for R analysis in an Excel world.

As R begins to replace a lot Excel work, a clear template is needed to explain how it works and offer fast development.

As soon as there is a copy and paste in Excel in something that is repeatable, we use R.
